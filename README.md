# SQL Mastery: From Basics to Advanced Concepts ðŸš€

Welcome! This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning SQL, covering everything from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Throughout my SQL learning journey, I explored essential topics and applied these skills by solving over 100+ questions based on an HR database.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- **Data Types and Functions**: Learn the fundamentals of data retrieval, date/time functions, string manipulation, and more.
- **Joins and Subqueries**: Master table joins and complex subqueries for data merging and efficient querying.
- **Indexes and Transactions**: Optimize query performance with indexing and ensure data integrity with transactions.
- **Constraints and Triggers**: Implement data integrity with constraints and automate actions with triggers.
- **Views and Stored Procedures**: Organize and simplify data access with views and advance with stored procedures and PL/SQL.

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside
- **SQL Q&A Set**: A collection of SQL questions and answers covering diverse scenarios, built on an HR database.
- **HR Database SQL File**: The HR database structure used for practice, enabling you to apply SQL concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **HR Database Model Picture**: The HR database model picture provides a preview of database structure for deep and clear understanding.

### How to Use the HR Database for Practice
There is a `db.spl` file uploaded in this repository. To practice using the HR database:
1. **Create a New Database**: 
   - Create a new database in your SQL environment.
   
2. **Import the `db.spl` File**:
   - Import the `db.spl` file into the database. This file contains the schema and data for the HR database.
   
3. **Start Practicing**:
   - Once the database is set up, you can start using the SQL questions and queries provided in this repository to enhance your SQL skills.
